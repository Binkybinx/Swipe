# Swipe

The swipe website project helped me apply everything I've learned about HTML and CSS in a practical way. I used **HTML basics** to structure my site and different **CSS selectors** to style specific elements. The project also reinforced my understanding of the **box model**, as I worked with margins, padding, and borders to create clean layouts.

I got to work with **specificity and the cascade** to manage how my styles were applied without conflicts. I experimented with **backgrounds and gradients** to make the site visually appealing. **Transitions and transforms** were great for adding interactive elements and making the site more engaging. 

Using **flexbox** and **grid** helped me create flexible and responsive layouts, which was key in ensuring the website worked well across different screen sizes. I also used **media queries** to make it fully responsive.

The project gave me a chance to use **before and after pseudo-elements** to add decorative touches without cluttering my HTML, and I implemented modern CSS techniques like **variables** and the **calc() function**, which made my code more maintainable and easier to update.

Overall, this project was a great way to pull together everything Iâ€™ve learned and put it into practice.
